The following is what I think needs to be improved in my code:

It seems there are poorly thought out dependencies throughout the app, this became especially apparent when trying to
create mocks for unit tests.

Law of Demeter is violated

Class names all start with 'Weather'--clean code specifically tells you not to do this. Should refactor.

Names are ambiguous--I need to track down declarations to determine, for example, if chicagoWeather is a full API
response for the weather in chicago or if it is the "weather" subset of data (rainy, sunny etc).

Poor code coverage--71% classes, 66% lines, 53% methods
I also don't fully understand why some lines are considered 'covered' and some aren't--in Main class for example
the getTemp() method is not marked as covered but it is used in the tests. Maybe because it is just set with a mock?
In apiResponse classes, all the setters are marked as being covered but the getters are not.
