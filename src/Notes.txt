The following is what I think needs to be improved in my code:

It seems there are poorly thought out dependencies throughout the app, this became especially apparent when trying to
create mocks for unit tests.

Law of Demeter is violated

Class names all start with 'Weather'--clean code specifically tells you not to do this. Should refactor.

Names are ambiguous--I need to track down declarations to determine, for example, if chicagoWeather is a full API
response for the weather in chicago or if it is the "weather" subset of data (rainy, sunny etc).
